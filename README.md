![Predictiveworks.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skrusche63/spark-rest/master/images/predictiveworks.png)

**Predictiveworks.** is an open ensemble of predictive engines and has been made to cover a wide range of today's analytics 
requirements. **Predictiveworks.**  brings the power of predictive analytics to Elasticsearch.

For easy and flexible integration every engine has a REST API and is accessible as an Akka enabled remote service.

## Predictiveworks. REST API

The REST API for **Predictiveworks.** provides a one-stop strategy to the different predictive engines via a common interface:

### [Reactive Association Analysis Engine](https://github.com/skrusche63/spark-arules)

![Association Analysis Engine Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skrusche63/spark-rest/master/images/association-rules-overview.png)

The Association Analysis Engine is one of the nine members of the open ensemble and is built to support association rule mining with a new and redefined 
mining algorithm. The approach overcomes the well-known "threshold problem" and makes it a lot easier to directly leverage the resulting content and product rules.


### Reactive Context-Aware Analysis Engine

![Factorization Machines Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skrusche63/spark-rest/master/images/factorization-machines-overview.png)

The Context-Aware Analysis Engine is one of the nine members of the open ensemble and has a strong focus on context-sensitive data and interactions in 
multi-dimensional datasets. It is the key to the next-generation of personalized predictions and customer relationships.
  

### Reactive Decision Analysis Engine

The Decision Analysis Engine is one of the nine members of the open ensemble and is built to predict the best decisions among multiple courses of action 
and identify their decisive factors. The machine learning algorithm is unexcelled in accuracy among current algorithms and is based on ensemble learning 
and powerful randomization strategies. 


### Reactive Intent Recognition Engine

The Similarity Analysis Engine is one of the nine members of the open ensemble and is built to find relevant similarities in dynamic activity sequences and 
identify customers by their journeys. It is based on the new S2MP algorithm to find similarities for sequential patterns in large scale datasets. 


### Reactive Text Analysis Engine
